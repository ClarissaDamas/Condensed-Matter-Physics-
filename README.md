#Condensed Matter(Physics)

A solid is said to be a crystal if atoms are arranged in such a way that their positions are exactly periodic, if we replace each atom by a geometrical point located at the equilibrium position of that atom, we obtain a crystal lattice. Classifying all possible crystal structures is too complex, so to describe a lattice we usually consider Bravais Lattice(in three dimensions, there are 14 distinct Bravais lattices).

This project returns the type of Bravais lattices based on your data about the axes and angles.

## Requirements
* Java programming language
* Java Development Kit

## Installation and Usage
* You need a text editor,IDE or similar that runs java.
* Run the code and will apper the Java Graphical User Interface.
* You should choose the options according to your data about axes and angles.
* Click on the button to receive your system result,you are free to try as many times as you need to.

## Roadmap
The project is going to have updates releases in the future.More Physics related projects and go deep with the calculation of the current one.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
